# GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

The link to my page is: https://andee777.github.io/

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item

And, of course emoji! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:
