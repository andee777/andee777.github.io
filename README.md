# GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

The link for the page is https://andee777.github.io/
